'''
You are a secret agent, and you receive an encrypted message
that needs to be decoded. The code that is being used flips
the message backwards and inserts non-alphabetic characters in
the message to make it hard to decipher. 
 
Task:  
Create a program that will take the encoded message,
flip it around, remove any characters that are not a letter or a space,
and output the hidden message. 
 
Input Format:   
A string of characters that represent the encoded message. 
 
Output Format:  
A string of character that represent the intended secret message. 
 
Sample Input:  
d89%l++5r19o7W *o=l645le9H 
 
Sample Output:  
Hello World

Explanation:  
If you remove everything that isn't a letter or space from the original
message and flip it around, you get 'Hello World'.
